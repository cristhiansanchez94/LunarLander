# LunarLander
Repository to host files related to the LunarLander experiment on Open AI Gym.


The following files were implemented: 
- LunaTrainer: This file contains the functions used to train the model in a specific environment. Also, it contains a function that generates the gif file. 
- LunaLauncher: The folder with the files of the environment where the rocket is launched instead of landed. The specific folder LunarLauncher/envs/ contains the file with the modifications to the LunarLander environment so the rocket flies to a specific position.
